**FoodWheel** is a startup delivery service that takes away the struggle of deciding where to eat.

FoodWheel picks you an amazing local restaurant and lets you order through the app. 

Senior leadership is getting ready for a big board meeting, and as the resident Data Analyst, you have been enlisted to help decipher data and create a presentation to answer several key questions:

1. What cuisines does FoodWheel offer? 

2. Which areas should the company search for more restaurants to partner with?

3. How has the average order amount changed over time?

4. What does this say about the trajectory of the company?

5. How much has each customer on FoodWheel spent over the past six months?

6. What can this tell us about the average FoodWheel customer?

In this project, we will analyze several DataFrames and create several visualizations to help answer these questions.

We'll Use *pandas* and *matplotlib* skills to analyze and visualize the FoodWheel dataset.
